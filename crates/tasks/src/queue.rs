//! Task queue and scheduler core (ACS-4), without storage: the rules every store must follow.
//!
//! This module is the reference behaviour of the CFA4-wide queue. It holds the tasks in memory;
//! the PostgreSQL store (`tasks` schema, PG-2, through `cfa4-store`) applies the same operations
//! inside transactions (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, the lease, the version check), and the tests
//! here are the contract it must pass. Time is passed in by the caller (UTC milliseconds), so the
//! scheduler is testable and never reads a clock itself.
//!
//! - **States** follow the SDK host report (version 2): `scheduled`, `queued`, `waiting` (for
//!   resources), `blocked` (no path fits: the client plans again or the user approves another
//!   path), `running`, `paused`, `cancelling`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`. AI sub-phases
//!   (`preparing_model`, `loading`) belong to `cfa4-ai-jobs`. Every change is checked against the
//!   allowed [`transition`]s and logged.
//! - **Order:** class first (P0 interactive, R final render, P1 background, P2 speculative), then
//!   the user's priority, then submission time. A task further down may start while one above
//!   waits for resources ("backfill"), but not once the one above has waited longer than
//!   [`QueueConfig::starvation_ms`]: then it goes first, so a big task is never starved.
//! - **Four start modes** ([`StartMode`]): now, when resources allow, at a time, at a time when
//!   resources allow. "Now" and "at a time" tell the user when the task has to wait; the other
//!   two wait quietly.
//! - **Exactly once:** a running task holds a lease ([`QueueConfig::lease_ms`]) that its
//!   supervisor renews. When it lapses (CFA4 or the machine stopped), a resumable task with a
//!   checkpoint is queued again from that checkpoint; any other task fails. A task never starts
//!   from the beginning a second time on its own.
//! - **Versions:** every change bumps the task's version; a change the user asks for names the
//!   version it saw, and a stale one is refused ([`QueueError::Stale`]).
//! - **Missed starts** (the machine was off at the scheduled time): run late, move to the next
//!   slot (the same local time in the task's IANA time zone, [`crate::schedule`]), or ask the
//!   user ([`MissedStart`]).
